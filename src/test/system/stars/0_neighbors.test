//These are all really great tests! The only thing I would say is potentially outputing the names instead of the ids. 
//I would also consider testing over-riding the csv file, and what happens when two equal distances are in the stars. 
//A few more multi-commands too might be helpful, like running two different naive neighbors back to back
