Project Name: Onboarding
Team Members: Michelle Lee
Time Spent on Project: 20 hours
--- However, this is because it took a while to onboard & get accustomed to Java

------------------ Design Choices ------------------
For this project I decided to create 2 new classes: CSV reader and stars.
As indicated by the name, CSV reader contains the method for reading a csv
and stars contains the methods for naive_neighbor. As a note, my nearestStar
function doesn't work right now && I've tried numerous implementation but it
still doesn't work.

I created two classes because I thought it would make the code easier to read. I
didn't want the main file to be too long. In addition, since we are dealing with
multiple star objects, it makes sense to create a class for this as opposed to
storing this data in a hashmap.

------------------ Errors and Bugs ------------------
As of right now, the naive_neighbors functions do not work because my nearestStar
method in the Stars file is not properly creating an array with the closest stars.

------------------ Testing ------------------
